PROGRAM SETUP
#############

On a Windows computer, install:
- Python 3.12.0
- Add Python to system path (Python generally located in C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\ after standard installation)
- Install required libraries for the workshop programs to run:
	- Micrsoft Visual Studio C++ tools 14.1 or greater: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
	- Microsoft Visual Studio redistributable 
	- Python libraries by typing in command line window: python -m pip install -r [PATH TO FILE]\requirements
- Install the Neuri GUI via command line: python -m pip install [PATH TO FILE]\neurigui-2.70-py3-none-any.whl
- Install the CP201x driver: After connecting the Neuri board, open the Hardware Manager and update the driver by pointing the installer to the CP201x folder
- A SYSTEM RESTART will berequired


EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
##################

- Place electrode paste (Ten20) on each electrode (the more the better).
- Connect electrodes to your body and board:
	- Blue: 	Chest above heart 			Input electrode
	- Red: 		Front of head (between hair and eyes) 	Reference electrode SRB2
	- Yellow 	Lower leg				Eletrical ground BIAS

MISSING: The LED part by Ideo-Maker (refer to PowerPoint)


RUN PROGRAMS
############

Two programs are required to run at the same time:
1. The Neuri GUI responsable for extracting signals from the Neuri board
2. The PRENDE_TU_MENTE program that allows for controlling the Arduino

Both programs need to be run SEQUENTIALLY (Neuri GUI first):
- Start the program by typing "python" in the command line. This will open a Python instance. Here, run:
	import neurigui.neuri_gui as ng 
	ng.Run()
- Chose the connection port (first parameter)
- You can leave all other parameters as they are

Secondly, start the PRENDE_TU_MENTE program:
- Double-click on the PRENDE_TU_MENTE.py file
- After startup, it will ask you for the connection port. Chose the connection port of the Arduino, NOT the Neuri board.
- Set the threshold on the right axis to turn on the Arduino LED specifically during heart beats


TROUBLESHOOTING
###############

1. If the signal quality is not allowing to distinguish between background signal and heart beats, place the lead electrode on the SIDE of the chest

2. If the programs seem to be stuck, most probably the wrong ports have been selected Check the port names (ie COM12 vs COM13)
